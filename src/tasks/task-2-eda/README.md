    AirQuality 2015to2020 - GMali

    -> Started EDA with the Kaggle dataset shared by Nirmala in above thread. Focusing on substations of Mumbai City.
    -> Each sub-station has individual pattern of pollutants
    -> Pollutants have different concentrations and presence across each substation
    -> Xylene and Toulene have no correlation as they are the highest missing data points.
    -> As pointed out by Anjana here; https://airqualitypro-mn29310.slack.com/archives/C04RWNV4KV0/p1678000205925889 PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 are following the strong correlation to AQI. However, O3 and SO2 have very weak correlation, it could be the bias of the dataset in question at the moment.
